# keyloggers
Keylogging is the technology which is used to fetch the log data of the user without their acknowledgment. I developed this code in the python which runs on the command prompt.
Keyloggers are often used as a spyware tool by cybercriminals to steal personally identifiable information (PII), login credentials and sensitive enterprise data.

Some uses of keyloggers could be considered ethical or appropriate in varying degrees. Keylogger recorders may also be used by:

employers to observe employees' computer activities;
parents to supervise their children's internet usage;
device owners to track possible unauthorized activity on their devices; or
law enforcement agencies to analyze incidents involving computer use.

Objective of the project:
The purpose of this application is to keep tracks on every key that is typed through the keyboard and send it to the admin through the mail server in the time set or given. It provides confidentiality as well as data recovery to all the IT infrastructures in need.
